*TODO
** Rename project and stuff sometime to actual project name
** Some function to create unique ID's for new screening based on film name and screening date time
** Store film date as an instant - will also need conversion back to clj-time local date time again in get-by-id method
** Some clojure script to hide/show screening meta data on add depending on type of screening
